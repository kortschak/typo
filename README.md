# Typo

Package typo implements the game of typogenetics as described in GÃ¶del, Escher Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid by Douglas Hofstadter.

This is a reimplementation of the game reprising an implementation I made in 1991 for an undergraduate course in system modelling. That original implementation was written in HyperTalk using Hypercard. This one is faster.
